# Individual Investor Research Report: Boston/New England
**Prepared for:** Worcester-Based Sustainable Real Estate Development Firm
**Research Date:** January 2026
**Focus:** High-net-worth individuals, angel investors, and family office principals aligned with sustainable real estate development

---

## Executive Summary & Important Limitation

**Finding:** Research into individual investors reveals significant privacy constraints that limit public availability of specific contact information for high-net-worth individuals and family office principals.

**Why This Matters:**
- Family offices and HNWIs prioritize privacy and discretion
- Direct contact information is rarely public
- Individual investors typically operate through established networks, wealth managers, or angel groups
- Cold outreach to individuals is generally less effective than network-based approaches

**What This Report Provides:**
1. **Identified Angel Networks & Syndicates** - Access points to 500+ individual investors
2. **Publicly Known Individual Investors** - Individuals with public investment profiles
3. **Family Offices with Public Presence** - Family investment vehicles that accept outreach
4. **Networking Strategy** - Actionable approach to reaching individual investors
5. **Event Calendar** - Key gatherings where individual investors congregate
