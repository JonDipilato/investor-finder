# Conversation Guide: Presenting to Brenden

## The Opener (Casual / Coffee / Phone)

**You:** "Brenden, I've been doing some research on the New England real estate investment landscape, and I found some things I thought might be useful for the firm. Mind if I walk you through what I uncovered?"

**Key positioning:** Curiosity-driven, helpful, confident - not "I need you to hire me"

---

## The Hook (Get Him Interested)

**Say this:**

"I was looking at sustainable real estate capital in New England, and a few things jumped out:

1. **Rockpoint Group** - They're right here in Boston at 500 Boylston, just raised a $5.1B fund in 2024, and have 95,000 multifamily units deployed. Fresh capital looking for deals.

2. **LaunchPad Venture Group** - This is an angel network with 175+ individual investors. They've put $125M+ into 150+ companies since 2001. That's a lot of individual capital you could tap.

3. **The Davis Companies** - Another Boston firm, $12.8B in assets, just raised a nearly $1B fund. Very similar business model to yours.

I put together a brief with 6 priority investors - 3 institutional, 3 individual/angel channels - if you'd find it useful."

---

## The Handoff (Give Him Something)

**Then say:**

"I created a summary document with those 6 investors and contact info. It's not everything I found - I have about 40 more firms mapped out plus full individual investor strategies - but this gives you the highest-probability near-term opportunities."

**Send/share the brief at this point**

---

## The "No Strings" Close (Crucial)

**Say this:**

"No pressure at all on this. I just came across the information and thought it could be valuable. If any of these investors look interesting, I'm happy to dig deeper on specific ones, help with outreach materials, or make connections through my network. Otherwise, just good to know what's out there."

**This does three things:**
- Shows confidence (you're not needy)
- Creates intrigue (you have more if he wants it)
- Opens door for ongoing help (without demanding it)

---

## If He Asks "What's Your Angle?"

**Your response:**

"Honestly, I enjoy the research and I'm interested in the real estate/impact space. I'd love to stay involved with the firm in whatever way makes sense - could be ongoing market intelligence, investor outreach support, or just being a resource when needed. No pressure either way."

---

## If He Wants to See Everything

**Your response:**

"Absolutely. I have a full database with 40+ institutional investors, detailed profiles on each, plus a whole separate strategy for individual investors through angel networks and family offices. It's a lot of information - I can share the full documents or walk through whichever categories are most relevant to what you're working on."

**This is your green light to share the full research documents.**

---

## If He Wants to Discuss Further / Compensate You

**Let him lead here**, but if asked directly:

**Your response:**

"I'm open to figuring out what makes sense. Could be project-based for specific investor outreach, ongoing advisory as you build out partnerships, or we can play it by ear. Main thing is I want to add real value and be helpful to the business."

---

## If He's Interested in Individual Investors

**Say this:**

"That's actually a whole separate piece of research I did. Individual investors are trickier - privacy concerns mean you can't just find their contact info publicly. But I mapped out the angel networks, the events they attend, and strategies for reaching them through warm introductions. LaunchPad Venture Group alone has 175+ individual investors, and there are similar networks across Boston."

## Key Phrases to Use (Confident, Not Needy)

✅ **Good:**
- "No pressure on this"
- "I'd be happy to dig deeper on whichever ones look interesting"
- "Main thing is I want to be helpful"
- "Let's play it by ear and see what makes sense"
- "I have more detail if useful"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "I really want to work with you"
- "What can I do to help?"
- "I spent a lot of time on this" (sounds defensive)
- "I can do more if you need me"

## Post-Conversation Follow-Up

**If he seemed interested but didn't commit to next steps:**

Send 2-3 days later:
> "Hey Brenden - enjoyed the chat. Quick follow-up: I noticed Fifth Wall just led another climate-tech real estate deal last week. If sustainable real estate investors are a priority, let me know and I can pull together a targeted brief on the climate-focused VCs actively deploying in our space."

**This:**
- Adds value without pressure
- Shows you have more depth
- Gives him an easy "yes" if interested

---

## If He Asks You to Help with Outreach

**This is your opportunity - suggest:**

1. **Customize materials for specific investors**
2. **Facilitate warm introductions through your network**
3. **Prepare him for meetings with investor backgrounds/talking points**
4. **Track and follow up on investor conversations**

---

## Remember: Your Value Proposition

You're offering:
1. **Time savings** - He didn't have to do this research
2. **Credible leads** - Real investors with real capital
3. **Strategic insight** - You understand his business and the market
4. **Ongoing resource** - You can keep providing value

The "teaser" approach works because:
- The 6 investors you gave him are genuinely actionable
- He can see the quality and depth of your work
- He knows you have more (40+ firms, individual strategies)
- He has to engage you further to get it all

**Confidence + Value + No Pressure = Intrigue**
