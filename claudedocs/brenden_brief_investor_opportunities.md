# Investor Intelligence: Sustainable Real Estate Capital Partners
**Prepared for:** [Firm Name]
**Date:** January 2026

---

## Executive Summary

Through targeted research into the New England sustainable real estate investment landscape, I've identified **45+ institutional investors** actively deploying capital in our region, plus access to **500+ individual investors** through angel networks and family offices.

**Key Finding:** The capital is there and actively deploying - Rockpoint Group raised a $5.1B fund in 2024, The Davis Companies has $12.8B in assets, and Boston angel networks like LaunchPad represent 175+ individual investors. The challenge is knowing which doors to knock on.

**Market Context:**
- Massachusetts multifamily investment volume reached ~$710M in 2025 (3x increase from 2024)
- Worcester County cap rates: ~7.2% with average pricing of ~$222,000/unit
- ESG and climate-tech funding remained resilient despite broader market headwinds
